<p>God has created all things and said it was good.  And this was done without a woman.  God brought the idea of a woman when he said he saw that out of all the creation there was no mate for Adam.  He created all the animals both male and female.  But for Adam there was  none of the animals that fit Adam. But so that Adam will not be alone, God brought the idea of a woman.  So that Adam will not be working alone,  God gave him Eve to help him.</p>
